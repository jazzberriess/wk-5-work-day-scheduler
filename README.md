## Work Day Planner

A simple work day planner built using jQuery, Javascript, Bootstrap, HTML and CSS to help keep you ontop of your daily tasks.

This app makes use of localStorage to set and get memos/task list and moment.js to help keep you on track and on time.

During this project, I learned how to integrate external libraries/third-party API's to help navigate the DOM and assist with a consistent style across the various elements in the page.
