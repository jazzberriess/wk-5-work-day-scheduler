## Work Day Planner

A simple work day planner to help keep you ontop of your daily tasks from 9am to 5pm. It is colour coded to help you identify past, present and future tasks.

You can also remove tasks once they've been completed, or if they've changed.

This app makes use of localStorage to set and get memos/task list while moment.js helps keep you on track and on time.
